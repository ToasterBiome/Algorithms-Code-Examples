## Fisher-Yates Shuffle Example
In the FisherYatesShuffle subfolder you'll find a code example for a pretty ordinary Fisher-Yates shuffle. I like what the videos covered but didn't particiularly agree with all the refactoring going on. Breaking it down more seems kind of useless, as I think you can explain what the algorithm does using comments instead of a million functions, so I kept it simple and basic.
