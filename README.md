# Algorithms Code Examples
This is to document my progress in Algorithms.


## Notation Examples
Within NotationExamples.cs there are examples of O(1), O(n) and O(n^2) Big O notation. I did my best to explain how they fit that notation even if the solutions are intentionally terrible for examples' sake.

## Fisher-Yates Shuffle Example
In the FisherYatesShuffle subfolder you'll find a code example for a pretty ordinary Fisher-Yates shuffle. I like what the videos covered but didn't particiularly agree with all the refactoring going on. Breaking it down more seems kind of useless, as I think you can explain what the algorithm does using comments instead of a million functions, so I kept it simple and basic.

## Data Structures
In DataStructures.cs I go through using a Hashtable, some classic Array work, and go over the similiarities and differences of a Stack and Queue. My examples seem a bit lacking as I can't find a very good use for Stack but I'm sure one will present itself! I've used Queues before so I have some experience with how they work.
